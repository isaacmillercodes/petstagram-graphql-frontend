# Intro to Client Side GraphQL with React and Apollo

This project was designed as a demo for of a talk introducing developers how to use GraphQL on the front end with React and Apollo.

This talk is preceded my tutorial on [server side GraphQL](https://github.com/isaacmillercodes/petstagram-graphql-backend) with Express, PostgreSQL, and Knex.js

You can view a video of my presentation on this project from the Node.js Denver Meetup and follow along with my slides via the links below:
